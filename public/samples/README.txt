# Sample Images for Feature Detection

This directory contains sample satellite images for testing the feature detection capabilities:

## Original Samples
1. `vegetation.jpg` - Global vegetation map showing forest cover
2. `water.jpg` - Earth image showing oceans and water bodies
3. `urban.jpg` - Satellite image of New York City showing urban development
4. `clouds.jpg` - Earth image with cloud coverage
5. `mixed.jpg` - Mixed features satellite image
6. `test2.png` - Test image for multiple features

## New Samples (in /new folder)
7. `agricultural.jpg` - Agricultural fields from ESA showing vegetation patterns
8. `clouds.jpg` - Von Karman vortices cloud formations from ESA
9. `dubai.jpg` - Urban development in Dubai from ESA
10. `nile.jpg` - Nile Delta showing mixed features (vegetation, water, urban) from ESA
11. `sanfrancisco.jpg` - San Francisco Bay Area with urban and water features from NASA
12. `venice.jpg` - Venice lagoon showing water features from ESA
13. `deforestation.jpg` - Amazon deforestation sample

These images can be used to test the different feature detection algorithms:
- Vegetation detection
- Water body detection
- Urban area detection
- Cloud coverage detection
